C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language.

## What is C++?

C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. It gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

## Key Features:

- **Object-Oriented**: Supports classes and objects
- **Portable**: Can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms
- **Mid-level**: Combins features of both high-level and low-level languages
- **Rich Library**: Has a rich set of library functions
- **Speed**: C++ programs tend to be very fast

## Why Learn C++?

- C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages
- Used in operating systems, graphical user interfaces, and embedded systems
- Great for performance-critical applications
- Basis for understanding other programming languages
