Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

## Key Features:
- **Platform Independent**: Write once, run anywhere (WORA)
- **Object-Oriented**: Follows OOP principles
- **Simple and Familiar**: C/C++ like syntax
- **Secure**: Built-in security features
- **Multithreaded**: Can perform multiple tasks simultaneously
- **High Performance**: Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler

## Java Platforms:
- **Java SE** (Standard Edition)
- **Java EE** (Enterprise Edition)
- **Java ME** (Micro Edition)

## First Java Program:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
